abstract: In this study, a unified framework, capable of simultaneously modelling stratigraphic variation and spatial variability of soil properties through 
          machine learning of limited site investigation data, is combined with the finite-element method and Monte Carlo simulation for spatio-temporal 
          consolidation analysis of reclaimed lands.
