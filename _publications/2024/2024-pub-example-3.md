A domain-specific training image database is first established using generative adversarial networks (GAN) that enable the generation of arbitrary sized image samples from a single training image. Subsequently, multiple qualified image samples that are compatible with site-specific data are adaptively selected and utilized for the ensemble learning of geological cross-sections.
