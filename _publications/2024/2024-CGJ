abstract:      In this study, a non-parametric and continuous variable-based spatial predictor that leverages the signed distance function and Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) 
                is proposed for subsurface stratigraphic modelling. The proposed method transforms sparse categorical borehole data from a low-dimensional space into continuous 
                variables in a high-dimensional space, enabling a comprehensive representation of more implicit characteristics of intricate geological patterns..
