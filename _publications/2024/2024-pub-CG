abstract:       Although there has been extensive research on bored energy piles, the understanding about the thermomechanical performance of 
driven energy piles remains limited. In this study, a unified numerical modeling campaign is proposed to investigate the thermomechanical behaviors
of driven energy piles in sand under cyclic thermal loading conditions. The pile-driving process is simulated using the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian 
(CEL) technique, and the obtained post-installation results are mapped to an axisymmetric finite element model to analyze the thermomechanical behavior
of driven energy piles.
