abstract:      This study proposes an ensemble learning framework that leverages physics-informed neural networks (PINN) for parameter estimation. 
                Multiple representative SWCCs following different function forms are compiled, providing flexible learning basis to construct arbitrary
                SWCC. For a specific slope, the most compatible basis combination is adaptively selected based on limited site-specific measurements 
                before being mobilized for forward predictions of hydraulic behavior.
