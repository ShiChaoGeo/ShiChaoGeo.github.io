abstract: Although pure data-driven models demonstrate strong performance within their training domain, i.e., in-sample prediction, they 
          lack interpretability and might have poor generalization outside the training domain, i.e., out-of-sample prediction, particularly when 
        the observed geodata is limited. Moreover, these models often disregard valuable geotechnical domain knowledge. To address these limitations, 
        a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) is developed for both forward and inverse analyses of two-dimensional soil consolidations when 
        only limited measurements are available.
