abstract:       Probabilistic interpretation of subsurface stratigraphy from sparse boreholes and cone penetration tests (CPTs) remains a critical yet nontrivial task in geotechnical site characterization. 
                The challenge primarily arises from three key factors: (1) the modality gap between categorical borehole data and continuous CPT soundings; (2) the noisy and oscillatory nature of CPT profiles;
                and (3) the spatial variability of geological settings. This study proposes a dual-modal feature learning approach for semi-supervised learning of subsurface stratigraphy from sparse site-specific data with quantified uncertainty.
