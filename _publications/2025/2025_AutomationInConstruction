abstract:      This paper develops a customized LLM-based agent named “Geologist” to streamline geotechnical site planning and subsequent
                geological interpretation. A Multihop-Retrieval-Augmented Generation system is proposed to retrieve site-specific requirements 
                from multiple site investigation design codes. Moreover, a progressive human-machine collaboration scheme is orchestrated for 
                interpretable geological modelling. The efficiency of the proposed LLM-guided paradigm is validated through illustrative 
                examples and real-world case histories.
