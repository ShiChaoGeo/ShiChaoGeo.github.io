abstract:       Energy piles combine structural support with ground-source heat exchange, enabling effective seasonal thermal storage. However, long-term cyclic thermal loads on piles can induce complex thermo-mechanical interactions with surrounding soils. Predicting the long-term performance of energy piles is crucial for reliable foundation design but remains challenging due to limited monitoring data, significant parameter uncertainty, and the high computational cost of fully coupled numerical analyses. To address these challenges, this study proposes a multi-objective sparse ensemble learning (MO-SEL) framework that combines physics-informed load transfer functions with sequential sparse Bayesian learning to predict long-term pile performance.
