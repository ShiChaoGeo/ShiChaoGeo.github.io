abstract:      Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved remarkable milestones and surpassed human capabilities in many fields, such as Go and image recognition. There have been numerous efforts to leverage AI in promoting digitalization and automation in civil engineering. This is particularly challenging in geotechnical engineering, where geological modelling still heavily depends on subjective prior knowledge and is hindered by data scarcity. Therefore, incorporating valuable prior knowledge for the automatic development of subsurface geological cross-sections from sparse geodata remains an unsolved challenge. 
                To address these issues, this study proposes a few-shot learning strategy based on large language models (LLMs) to generate two-dimensional geological cross-sections from sparse site investigation data...
