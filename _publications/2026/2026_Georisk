abstract:       Land reclamation is vital for urban development in coastal cities such as Hong Kong. However, the long-term consolidation settlement of fine-grained materials poses significant risks to infrastructure safety and serviceability. It is imperative to accurately delineate subsurface stratigraphic distributions from sparse data for reliable geotechnical design. Conventional approaches typically assume stationary stratigraphic patterns of multiple layers within a single geological cross-section, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity of different strata and the importance of site-specific engineering judgement. In this study, a divide-and-conquer framework is developed to predict nonstationary subsurface stratigraphic patterns from limited cone penetration tests (CPTs), explicitly incorporating engineering judgement.
